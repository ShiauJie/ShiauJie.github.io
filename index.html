    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
           Currently, my research is about type Ia supernova. 
           I study type Ia supernovae from the hydrodynamical aspect. 
           We focus on how the companion star will evolve after the explosion.
           I am curious about how analytical and numerical solution complements each other. 
           I had been an intern student at both physics (ASIOP) and astronomy (ASIAA) institute in Academia Sinica.
           I had explored various research fields, especially astronomy and high energy physics. <br>
           I also enjoy teaching. Now I am teaching students in the challenge at NTHU resource center.
